- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stormy1Mace
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things; learning to code, rock climbing, yoga, reading, sociology, tea and more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, I'm a beginner but I'm really enjoying it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you may suggest, when you don't mind working with a newbie:)
- 📫 How to reach me: through this platform only, or my email which you can ask me for.
